Pata space Kenya is an online house and office listing system that links the house owner, we the pata space  and the customer in looking for a convinient house or office space in Nairobi.
can we include a google map that shows people location of other industries in
 	town?

The agreement to meet with the house owner incorporates?
	his name,

how will each house manager be given the account to manage his/her house?
	I need a good backend that generates a unique id for each house manager,
	and captures his detail. Upon creation of an account with us,he/she has got 
	his space and is allowed to post his house.

how will the payment be handled??

	each landlord has to pay 100kes for each building and a commission for each
	house gotten throught the system.. a  sample

problem definition:
	


merits:
	can provide enought knowledge to the landlord or landlady which of his 
	house is empty or occupied.
	the landlady/landlord can make some of the improvements based on the user
	reviews provided by the users
	can reduce tarmacking for consumers looking for houses and thus saving a lot of time
	help combart online spamming as the user will be sure of what he sees, is 
	legit

//system working
	if a client likes a house or on office and the premise is not vacant,
	the owner can tell if it's soon going to be vacant or not and in this way
	the client can be able to book through our system 'at a fee'
	
	house is removed from the portal after it has been sold

//other things
	we can help users look for a house at a small fee
	house comparison feature
	user feedback upon entering a new house
